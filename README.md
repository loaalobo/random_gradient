This exercise has been done by me (with some changes) from the course "The Complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery". 
The challenge was:

1. Write code so that the colour inputs match the background generated on the first page load. 

2. Display the initial CSS linear gradient property on page load.

3. BONUS: Add a random button which generates two random numbers for the colour inputs.
